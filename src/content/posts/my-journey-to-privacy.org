A decade ago, it was easier for ordinary people to start using the internet
without having any concerns about being spied on. Accessibility of the internet
hadn’t been grown like what we have today, so it wasn’t such a tasty platform
for most of the people of the world.

However, that was a long long time ago and the accessibility and usability of
the internet platform have changed dramatically. Some of us can’t even imagine
living a day without our smartphones (or having the smartphone without
internet). We schedule our days on it, we communicate to each other using it, we
surf the internet and read books, watch movies, listen to music and basically a
huge amount of our daily activities relies on it. Yes we are dependent to
it. Is it bad?  Not particularly.

This technology is more complicated than any advanced technology that the human
race ever made. It isn't that simple to categorize it as a good or bad
technology. The internet can have a lot of benefitical effects on our lives.

However, one of the potentials of the internet technology is that it can be used
as a weapon. Corporations can use it as a marketing tool to trick people into
buying their products or manipulate their desires. And the same sword in the
hands of the state and media can redirect crowds of people to the goals that are
not beneficial to all residents of the community or future generations. Of
course in its basic soul, every knife can be used for good or bad reasons, but
in a world which is fueled by money, it's almost always aiming for the goal of
making the reach reacher, no matter what.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari][Yuval Noah Harari]] has a great talk which describes this matter more in
depth. The video of this talk is available here:

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky][Noam Chomsky]] shares the same mindset in an interview where he quotes [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshana_Zuboff][Shoshana
Zuboff]] to call this act [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism][Surveillance Capitalism]]. This video is available here:

As a software developer, I spend a lot of my life using the internet and I can’t
imagine not using it. Actually, the relation of my country’s government toward
the internet makes me to always carry the fear of losing access to it someday.

On the other hand, the news of privacy leaks (which are increasing day by day
especially in the recent years) and learning the potential of these attacks made
me to decide to learn more about it and try to prevent myself from being exposed to
their potential harm. Of course, like a lot of ignorant people, I can consider
myself an ordinary person and claim that there isn’t much interesting data on me
to make me a potential target. But I don’t like to be played like a puppet in
the hand of corporations or states.

This may sound easy, but it’s absolutely not. You can’t unplug yourself by
choosing the right color of pill. To achieve this goal, I should work on my
personal skill set as well as my computer skills.

As a personal goal in 2019, I want to share what I learn through my journey on
this blog. Some posts may cover the technological aspect of the matter and some
may share my comments on the ideas I learned within books or speeches. So this
is it. Let the journey begin.
